# DB-Playground

Yet another zoo of database implementations. 

db-x: executables, a driver for everything (WIP)
db-core: storage engine implementation. 
db-test: test utilities, namely various workloads. 
db-lang: DSL stuff, not implemented. 
db-typing: abstractions over storage engine and transaction, adding more stuff to it.
